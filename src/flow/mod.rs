/// `FlowGraph` is the main entry point for all of distributary. It provides methods to construct,
/// update, and execute a data flow graph.
///
/// The `FlowGraph` is heavily parameterized to simplify testing. Admittedly, the type signature
/// could probably be simplified while maintaining enough flexibility for testing, but oh well. The
/// type arguments are:
///
///  - `Q`: The type used for queries that are issued across the edges of the graph in
///         `View::find()`.
///  - `U`: The type used for updates that propagate through the graph.
///  - `D`: The type used for records (`D`ata), i.e., what is returned by view queries, and what is
///         inserted by users of `FlowGraph` using the channels returned by `run()`.
///
/// When a new `FlowGraph` has been constructed, it will first be used to construct a graph using
/// `incorporate()`. This method takes a `View`, and asks the operator for its set of ancestor
/// nodes to hook it into the graph. In general, any `NodeType` can be used to make a view by
/// passing it to `new` along with its field names and a boolean marking whether that node should
/// be materialized. To construct a simple two-node graph that logs votes and keeps vote counts up
/// to date:
///
/// ```
/// use distributary::*;
///
/// let mut g = FlowGraph::new();
///
/// // set up a base node and a view
/// let vote = g.incorporate(new("vote", &["user", "id"], true, Base {}));
/// let votecount = g.incorporate(
///     new("vc", &["id", "votes"], true, Aggregation::COUNT.over(vote, 0, &[1]))
/// );
/// # drop(vote);
/// # drop(votecount);
/// ```
///
/// Once a graph has been constructed, `run()` should be called to start execution of the data flow
/// graph. `run()` returns objects that can be used to insert records and query the various views
/// in the graph:
///
/// ```
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate shortcut;
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate distributary;
/// # fn main() {
